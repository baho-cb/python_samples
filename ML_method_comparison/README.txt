I have used 4 different methods, each has it's own folder.
"plotters" folder contains the plotting scripts and the data that was plotted.

There is a bash script called "runner.sh" in every method folder. They have the
code to run the training/testing scripts.
For "neural_net" folder training and testing are done separately due to RAM issues.
