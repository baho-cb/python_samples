# python_samples
Contains some of my python scripts belonging to several different projects

Brief description from newest to oldest (I'm not sure how many scripts you would like to have a look at but I suggest you go in this order) : 

**neuralnet_assisted_MD** : This contains a NVT-MD simulation code that has a neural-net to calculate interactions bypassing costly distance calculations. 

**neural_net_training** : The NNs that are used above are were trained here. 

**rigid_body_analysis** : Calculates pair correlation function, mean squeare displacement, mean rotation of rigid body simulations in order to assess their accuracy relative to traditional MD simulations 

**visualization** : Two plotting scripts 

**ML method comparison** : Several ML methods (decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbirs, neural-nets) were compared on the same classification task (to predict whether two rigid bodies interact) 

**hoomd_rigid_body_simulator** : Scripts that setup a system of rigid bodies (cubes, cylinders, etc.) to be simulated with hoomd. 

**aggregate_analysis_scripts** : Scripts for analyzing aggregates-clusters of various microplastic particles in quiescent and shear flow conditions, from earlier.   

**microgels** : Some scripts for microgel generation, simulation and analysis from the 1st year of my PhD   

I have a lot more scripts that are somewhat less structured-organized but I can share those as well, if you want to.
